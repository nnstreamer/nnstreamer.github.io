Edge pipeline - Query\nTensor query allows devices which have weak AI computational power to use resources from higher-performance devices.\nSuppose you have a device at home with sufficient computing power (server) and a network of lightweight devices connected to it (clients).\nThe client asks the server to handle heavy tasks and receives results from the server. Therefore, there is no need for cloud server by running AI on a local network.\nIn this tutorial, the client sends a video frame to the server, then the server performs object detection and sends the result to the client.\n"});
