In this policy, every buffer which has pts is within duration from base time stamp is merged/muxed. For the case of buffer with greater pts than base timestamp plus duration, previous buffer is going to used instead.\nTest case with \"sync-mode=basepad sync-option=0:33333333\" is below,\nThe base timestamp is 0, so that every buffer of srcpad0 is pushed to downstream.\n"});
