Remember: you may be the only one writing the code initially, but many people will need to read, understand, modify, and fix the code over its lifetime. These conventions attempt to make this task much easier. If the code consistently follows these standards, it improves developer understanding across the entire source base.\nTo make it easy to debug the code, with both a system call tracer and GNU debuggers. It should be easy to set breakpoints, view locals, and display and view data structures.\nTo attempt to improve code quality through consistency, and requiring patterns that are less likely to result in bugs either initially, or after code modification.\n\n"});
