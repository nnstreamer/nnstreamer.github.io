fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"component-description.html#page-description","fragment":"The findtype specifics: refer to the wiki (other/tensorsave (canceled))\nEach frame of an other/tensor or other/tensors stream should have only ONE instance of other/tensor or other/tensors.\nExcept tensor_decoder, which accepts data semantics from pipeline developers, and tensor_converter, which accepts data semantics from sink pad caps, every NNStreamer tensor plugin and tensor stream should be agnostic to the data semantics. With data semantics, we know whether the corresponding tensor denotes for video, audio, text, or any other \"meaningful data types\". The NNStreamer elements and data-pipeline, being agnostic to such semantics, should treat every other/tensor and other/tensors as multi-dimensional arrays of general numbers.\nNote that \"stable\" does not mean that it is complete. It means that it has enough test cases and complies with the overall design; thus, \"stable\" features probably won't be modified extensively. Features marked \"experimental\" can be modified extensively due to its incomplete design and implementation or crudeness. \"Planned\" is still in the works so it will be released soon.\nIn this page, we focus on the status of each elements. For requirements and designs of each element, please refer to the README.md of the element.\nNote that test elements in /tests/ are not elements for applications. They exist as scaffoldings to test the above elements especially in the case where related elements are not yet implemented.\n\nother/tensor\nother/tensors\nother/tensorsave (planned --> canceled)\n\n\n\ntensor_converter\n\nVideo (stable)\n\nvideo/x-raw.
