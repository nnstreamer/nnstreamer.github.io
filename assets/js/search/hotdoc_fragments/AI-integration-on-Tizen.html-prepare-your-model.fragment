There are several ways:\nCheck NNStreamer/ML-API Tizen Examples\nFind web. There are many open models in the web.\nMake your own model (PyTorch)\nIn many cases, you need to use your own model. This model might be written from scratch or trained with your custom dataset. If your model is made with PyTorch, you can use ai-edge-torch to convert your model into TFLite format, so it can be used in Tizen.\n\nThere are many real examples you may find it useful.\n\n\nOfficial TFLite examples\n\nultralytics offers many YOLO based vision models.\n\nhuggingface or torchvision models\n\n\n"});
