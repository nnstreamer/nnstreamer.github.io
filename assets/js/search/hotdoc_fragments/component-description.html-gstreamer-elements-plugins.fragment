It means that it has enough test cases and complies with the overall design; thus, \"stable\" features probably won't be modified extensively. Features marked \"experimental\" can be modified extensively due to its incomplete design and implementation or crudeness. \"Planned\" is still in the works so it will be released soon.\nIn this page, we focus on the status of each elements. For requirements and designs of each element, please refer to the README.md of the element.\nNote that test elements in /tests/ are not elements for applications. They exist as scaffoldings to test the above elements especially in the case where related elements are not yet implemented.\n\n\ntensor_converter\n\nVideo (stable)\n\nvideo/x-raw.

Users should specify the number of frames in a single buffer, which denotes the number of frames in a single tensor frame with the property of frames-per-buffer.
