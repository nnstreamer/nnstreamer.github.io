This should be followed by a brief description of the file using the @brief command. If necessary, you can follow this with a more detailed description. Next you should put your name and andrew id, along with your partners name and andrew id, using the @author tag. This needs to be followed with a bugs section with a list of known bugs using the @bug command. If there are no known bugs, explicitly state that using the @bug command.\nBefore each function, data structure, and macro you should put a comment block giving at least a brief description using the @brief command. A brief description will suffice for your data structures but for your macros and functions you will need to use a few more commands. After your description, you should use the @param command to describe all of the parameters to your function. These descriptions should be followed by a description of the return value using the @return command.\nNote: When we say \"each\" function, that is not a strong statement. You can leave out simple helper functions, like a max() macro, so you do not waste time.\nYou have to use comments starting with ** and then the special command.\nYou have to use comments starting with ## and then the special command.\nYou have to use comments starting with ## and then the special command.\nThen, add @file and @brief tag to the top of each script file as follows.\nPlease, refer to http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html for more details.\nIf the Doxygen tag @mainpage is placed in a comment block, the block is used to\ncustomize the index page (in HTML) or the first chapter (in $@mbox{@LaTeX}$).\nThe title argument is optional and replaces the default title that doxygen\nnormally generates. If you do not want any title you can specify notitle\nas the argument of @mainpage.\nBelow is a simple example of a mainpage you can create yourself.\nRefer to https://github.com/Anvil/bash-doxygen\nDoxygen does not support bash script files by default.\nEdit below lines in a Doxyfile.ci to generate *.sh files.\n\nIf you want to run Doxygen to\nproduce documentation from your code comments, then in addition do the following:\n\nInstall Doxygen using the\ninstructions on its web site. For reference, the LLVM web site is using Doxygen 1.7.6.1,\nhowever the 1.8 series added support for Markdown formatting. We would like\nto use Markdown in our comments ASAP, so use the latest version of Doxygen.\n$ sudo apt-get install doxygen\n\n\nInstall Graphviz using instructions on their\nsite. The current version no longer modifies your path, so you should\nmanually modify your path so that it includes \"dot\".\n$ sudo apt-get install graphviz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Doxygen using the\ninstructions on its web site.
