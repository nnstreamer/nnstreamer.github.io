With data semantics, we know whether the corresponding tensor denotes for video, audio, text, or any other \"meaningful data types\". The NNStreamer elements and data-pipeline, being agnostic to such semantics, should treat every other/tensor and other/tensors as multi-dimensional arrays of general numbers.\n\nother/tensor\nother/tensors\nother/tensorsave (planned --> canceled)\n\n"});
