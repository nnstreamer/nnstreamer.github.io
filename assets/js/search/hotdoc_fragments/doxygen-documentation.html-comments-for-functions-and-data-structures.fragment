fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"doxygen-documentation.html#comments-for-functions-and-data-structures","fragment":"Comments for Functions and Data Structures\nBefore each function, data structure, and macro you should put a comment block giving at least a brief description using the @brief command. A brief description will suffice for your data structures but for your macros and functions you will need to use a few more commands. After your description, you should use the @param command to describe all of the parameters to your function. These descriptions should be followed by a description of the return value using the @return command.\nNote: When we say \"each\" function, that is not a strong statement. You can leave out simple helper functions, like a max() macro, so you do not waste time.\n"});
