As a result, \"scoped storage\" is introduced in Android 10 and enhanced in Android 11.\nIt makes an application has access only to the app-specific directory on external storage.\nWith scoped storage, consider either options below:\n(Recommended) Provide your model files with assets.\nCode example:\nProvide your model files with absolute path.\nCode example:\n\nPlace your model files in assets/models/.\nCopy it into app-specific directory using AssetManager.\nUse the File object with NNStreamer Java API.\n\n\nPlace your model files in the device's external storage.\n(If your app targets API level 30 (Android 11) or later) Set android:preserveLegacyExternalStorage=\"true\" in your AndroidManifest.xml to use the deprecated method getExternalStorageDirectory.\nUse method getExternalStorageDirectory to get the File object.\nUse the File object with NNStreamer Java API.\n\nNote: Use this option only for test purpose. This assumes that the model files should be in the right hardcoded path in the target device.\n\n"});
