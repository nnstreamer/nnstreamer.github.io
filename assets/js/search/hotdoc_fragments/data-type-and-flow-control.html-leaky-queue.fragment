With the timestamp values of frames, a queue may drop frames with different policies according to GStreamer applications. Such policies include:\nNote that in the case of many multi-modal neural networks, mux/merge elements are supposed to drop any older frames with incoming frames in the incoming (sink pad) queue.\n\nLeaky on upstream: Drop more recent frames, keep older frames\nLeaky on downstream: Drop older frames, keep newer frames\n\n"});
