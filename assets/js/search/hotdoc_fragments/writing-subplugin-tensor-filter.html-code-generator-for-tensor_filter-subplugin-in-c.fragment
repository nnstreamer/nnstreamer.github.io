It is in /templates/tensor_filter_subplugin of nnstreamer-example.git. The following is how to start writing a subplugin with the template for Tizen devices (5.5 M2 +). In this example, the target subplugin name is example.\nThen, in src directory, you can fill in the callbacks.\nIf you need to add dependencies for additional libraries of your own libraries, edit meson.build and packaging/*.spec accordingly as well.\nThen, use gbs to build and package your subplugin for Tizen:\nAlthough we supply a packaging script for Tizen only, the code and build script (meson.build) supports other software platforms as well; you may build it with meson and install to appropriate paths.\n"});
