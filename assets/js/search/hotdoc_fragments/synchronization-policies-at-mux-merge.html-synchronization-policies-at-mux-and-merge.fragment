fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"synchronization-policies-at-mux-merge.html#synchronization-policies-at-mux-and-merge","fragment":"Synchronization policies at Mux and Merge\nThere are multiple synchronization policies for tensor_mux and tensor_merge.\nThey are based on PTS ( presentation timestamp in nanoseconds (as a GstClockTime) ) and assume that every tensor buffer has PTS and can be accessed by GST_BUFFER_PTS(buf).\nHowever, there is stream which does not have PTS such as application/octet-stream. In such cases, tensor_converter generates timestamp and set PTS. If framerate is given, tensor_converter generates proper PTS according to framerate and for the case without framerate, PTS is decided with running time which is calculated as absolute-time - base-time.\nCurrently, three synchronization policies are implemented.\n"});
