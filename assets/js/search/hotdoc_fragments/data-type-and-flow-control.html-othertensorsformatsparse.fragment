fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"data-type-and-flow-control.html#othertensorsformatsparse","fragment":"other/tensors,format=sparse\nother/tensors,format=sparse allows to express sparse tensors (tensors with a lot of zeros) efficiently (in terms of memory size) by extending other/tensors,format=flexible.\nIn general, nnstreamer elements (tensors-*) do not support sparse tensors unlike static and flexible, although a few tensor-filter subplugins support sparse tensors.\nSparse tensors exist for efficient transmission and data storing.\nIf your source data streams or sink data streams are to be in sparse tensors, you may apply tensor_sparse_[enc|dec] to convert them from/to static tensors.\n"});
