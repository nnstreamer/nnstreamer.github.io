The first filter increases the value of tensor (brightness of video).\nThe average value is calculated in the path including the filter, and the two tensors are combined again in tensor_mux element.\nTensor_if element determines whether to exit the network or proceed to the next module by checking average value of the tensor.\nEarly exit module extra part is not an essential but it is added for demo purposes.\nAs depicted in Fig. 2, There are four early exit modules, each module is connected to join element when the condition 'early-exit' is met, and to the next module when it is not.\nJoin element connects recently arrived buffer from 5 input streams to ximagesink.\nIf you have successfully completed the build nnstreamer-example, you can run example:\n"});
