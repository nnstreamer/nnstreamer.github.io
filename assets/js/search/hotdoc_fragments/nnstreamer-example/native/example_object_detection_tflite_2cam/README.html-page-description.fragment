The detected boxes are drawen by cairooveray GStreamer plugin.\nRaspberry Pi 4\nUbuntu Server 18.04 arm64\n2 USB cameras (720p, 30fps)\nIt streams videos with 2 cameras to 2 different network ports.\nwarning: the device node for your camera may varing from /dev/video0 to /dev/videoN... so check your dmesg to make sure where is your camera node now.\nUbuntu Desktop 18.04\nIt gets video streams from 2 network ports and detects objects for each video.\nYou can see two windows for each video.\nThis example requires a tflite model, labels, and box priors.\nThe resources can be obtained from this link: https://github.com/nnsuite/testcases/raw/master/DeepLearningModels/tensorflow-lite/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco\nget-model.sh downloads the required model and other txt data files.\n\n\n"});
