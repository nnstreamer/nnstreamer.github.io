There are two examples for multi-model applications.\nBoth examples uses the neural network for face detection (detect_face.tflite) catches people's faces.\nOne example use neural network for object detection (ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.tflite) to predicts the label of given image.\nAnother example use neural network for pose estimation (posenet_mobilenet_v1_100_257x257_multi_kpt_stripped.tflite) to predict body parts and reflect the results in images. In this example, two eyes are masked with a black box for each faces like a parasite the movie poster. Currently, up to 3 faces can be masked using this function, but 2 faces are recommended due to optimization issue.\nThe results are drawn by cairooverlay GStreamer plugin.\nSince the example is based on GLib and GObject, these packages need to be installed before running. NumPy is also needed.\nThis example requires specific tflite models and label data.\nget-model.sh download these resources.\n"});
