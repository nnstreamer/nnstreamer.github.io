The detected boxes are drawen by cairooveray GStreamer plugin.\nThis example requires tflite model, labels and box priors.\nThe resources can be obtained from this link: https://github.com/nnsuite/testcases/raw/master/DeepLearningModels/tensorflow-lite/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco\nget-model.sh download the required model and other txt data files.\n\n"});
