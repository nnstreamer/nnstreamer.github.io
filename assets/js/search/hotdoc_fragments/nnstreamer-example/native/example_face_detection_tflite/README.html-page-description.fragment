The neural network detects faces of people in input stream.\nIf there are multiple faces in the video, detected faces which are not the largest one are pixelated.\nThe application takes advantage of cairooverlay GStreamer plugin.\nSince the example is based on GLib and GObject, these packages need to be installed before running. NumPy is also needed.\nThis example requires specific tflite model and label data.\nget-model.sh download these resources.\n"});
