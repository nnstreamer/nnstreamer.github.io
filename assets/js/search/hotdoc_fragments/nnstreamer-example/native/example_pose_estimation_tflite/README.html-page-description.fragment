The results are drawn by cairooveray GStreamer plugin.\nThis example requires pose estimation tf lite model and key point label (for body parts).\nThe public model can be obtained from this link: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/posenet_mobilenet_v1_100_257x257_multi_kpt_stripped.tflite\nget-model.sh download the required model and make label text file\n  \n"});
