We recommend to install nnstreamer by downloading prebuilt binary packages from Launchpad/PPA (Ubuntu) or Download.Tizen.org (Tizen). If you want to build nnstreamer in your system for your example application builds, pdebuild (Ubuntu) with PPA or gbs (Tizen) are recommended for building nnstreamer. This repository has been detached from nnstreamer.git to build examples independently from the nnstreamer source code since Jan-09-2019.\nUbuntu PPA: nnstreamer/ppa [PPA Main]\nTizen Project: devel:Tizen:6.0:AI [OBS Project] [RPM Repo]\nWe provide example nnstreamer applications:\n\nTraditional Linux native applications\n\nLinux/Ubuntu: GTK+ application\ngst-launch-1.0 based scripts\n\n\nTizen GUI Application\n\nTizen C/C++ application\nTizen .NET (C#) application\nTizen Web application\n\n\nAndroid applications\n\nNDK based C/C++ CLI applicaton\nJNI based GUI application\n\n\n\n\nLinux/Ubuntu: GTK+ application\ngst-launch-1.0 based scripts\n\n\nTizen C/C++ application\nTizen .NET (C#) application\nTizen Web application\n\n\nNDK based C/C++ CLI applicaton\nJNI based GUI application\n\n"});
