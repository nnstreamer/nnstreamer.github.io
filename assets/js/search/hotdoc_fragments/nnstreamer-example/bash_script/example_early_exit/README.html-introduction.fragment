Tensor_if determines whether to exit the network or proceed to the next path according to the confidence.\nIf confidence is high, exit the network immediately and if it is low, proceed to the next early exit module. As shown in Figure 2, multiple early exit modules can be connected.\nWhen the network ends early or reaches the end of the network, a join element connects recently arrived buffer from N input streams to one output pad.\n"});
