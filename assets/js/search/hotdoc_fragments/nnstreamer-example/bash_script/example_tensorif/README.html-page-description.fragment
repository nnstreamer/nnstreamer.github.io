The neural network detects faces of people in input stream.\nThe tensor_if element controls the data stream depending on whether the face is detected from the filter.\nIf the face is detected, start detecting objects.\nWhen the face is detected, the tensor_if operates in passthrough mode.\n\nWhen the face is detected, the tensor_if operates in tensorpick mode.\nIf there is a face, it detects the object, and if there is no face, it adjusts the colors of a video stream.\n\n"});
