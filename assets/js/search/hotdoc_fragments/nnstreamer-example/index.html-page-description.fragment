We recommend to install nnstreamer by downloading prebuilt binary packages from Launchpad/PPA (Ubuntu) or Download.Tizen.org (Tizen). If you want to build nnstreamer in your system for your example application builds, pdebuild (Ubuntu) with PPA or gbs (Tizen) are recommended for building nnstreamer.
