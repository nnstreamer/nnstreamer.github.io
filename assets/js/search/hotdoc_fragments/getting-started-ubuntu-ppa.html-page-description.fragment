In order to install it, use:\nYou need to rebuild nnstreamer's corresponding subplugins (e.g., nnstreamer-tensorflow) with the neural network framework version you want to use.\nTry to let prebuilt nnstreamer binaries use another versions of tensorflow/pytorch installed. Theoretically, it should work by simply replacing tensorflow/pytorch with different versions. Unless symbols and their semantics are changed, it should work. (but that happens often with neural network frameworks, which are still not that stable.)\n\nnnstreamer-caffe2 : Allows to use caffe2 models in a pipeline. (From pytorch 1.3.1 by default)\nnnstreamer-cpp : Allows to use C++ classes as filters of a pipeline.\nnnstreamer-cpp-dev : Required to build C++ class-filters.\nnnstreamer-dev : Required to build C function-filters and to build your own nnstreamer plugins.\nnnstreamer-edgetpu : Allows to use edge-TPU in a pipeline.\nnnstreamer-flatbuf : Allows to convert-from and decode-to flatbuf streams.\nnnstreamer-openvino : Allows to use OpenVINO (Intel), enabling Movidius-X.\nnnstreamer-protobuf : Allows to convert-from and decode-to protobuf streams.\nnnstreamer-python2 : Allows to use python2 classes as filters of a pipeline.\nnnstreamer-python3 : Allows to use python3 classes as filters of a pipeline.\nnnstreamer-pytorch : Allows to use Pytorch models in a pipeline.

You need to check the configuration (/etc/nnstreamer.ini and env-vars)\n\n"});
