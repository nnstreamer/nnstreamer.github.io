Note that Git LFS requires Git v1.8.5 or higher.\nPackagecloud (https://packagecloud.io) hosts git-lfs packages with apt/deb for popular Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.\nIf you are using another Linux distribution such as Fedora, Please refer to the below webpage.\nNote that default branch must be tizen instead of master in case of TAOS. We assume that you have to upload LibreOffice Installer\n(251MB) in a github repository.\nClone the github repository with upstream and origin.\nYou need to setup the global Git hooks for Git LFS.\nAdd all *.msi files through Git LFS.\nNow you are ready to push some commits\nYou can confirm that Git LFS is managing your *.msi file.\n\nInstalling git-lfs: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/v2.4.0/INSTALLING.md#installing-on-linux-using-packagecloud\n\n\nMethod 1:\n\n\nMethod 2:\n\n\nGetting Started: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/tree/v2.4.0#getting-started\nGit extension for versioning large files: https://git-lfs.github.com\n\n"});
