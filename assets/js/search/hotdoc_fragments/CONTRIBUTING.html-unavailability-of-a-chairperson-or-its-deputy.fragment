An available committer is a committer who has been submitting code commits or code reviews to the main project (nnstreamer.git) during the last 30 days. A senior committer is a committer who has committed codes to the main GitHub project (nnstreamer.git) before other available committers. Unavailability of chairperson and deputy can be declared via the mailing-list by a committer. The unavailability declaration becomes effective after the declaring committer tries to contact the chairperson or deputy personally, the declaration is acknowledged by other two or more committers, and there are no responses from chairperson or deputy via the mailing list or GitHub issues of the main project (nnstreamer.git) within 30 days. With the effective unavailability declaration, the most senior among available committers automatically becomes the deputy who holds the TSC meeting to elect a chairperson within the next 30 days. If the available senior committer fails to do this within the given 30 days after the effective declaration, the Linux Foundation Series manager may designate any TSC voting member of committer as a deputy chairperson and any TSC voting member or committer may contact Linux Foundation to initiate this process.\n"});
