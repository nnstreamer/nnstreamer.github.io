This is far more rich featured compared to Single API; however, the developer is required to understand GStreamer pipelines. For GStreamer pipelines in general, please refer to GStreamer documents.\nConstruct a pipeline (ml_pipeline_construct) and get a pipeline handle.\n(Optional) Attach callbacks or get other handles from the constructed pipeline. In order to attach callbacks or get handles, the corresponding elements should have names defined so that they can be recognized in run-time.\nStart the pipeline. The callbacks will be invoked during the pipeline execution. You may control it with the additional handles (e.g., input/output switches, valves).\nStop/Restart the pipeline.\nClose the pipeline handle.\n"});
