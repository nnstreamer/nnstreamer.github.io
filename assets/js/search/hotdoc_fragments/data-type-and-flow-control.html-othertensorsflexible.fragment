fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"data-type-and-flow-control.html#othertensorsflexible","fragment":"other/tensors-flexible\nother/tensors-flexible handles non-static, flexible tensor stream without specifying the data type and shape of tensor in pad capability.\nThis is useful when an element or a model requires non-determined, dynamic data shape to process the tensors. (e.g., cropping the raw data into multiple tensors)\nUnlike other/tensor and other/tensors, flexible tensor does not contain the data structure in pad capability.\nInstead, flexible tensor has its own data structure - GstTensorMetaInfo - in each tensor buffer, to prevent caps negotiation with fixed type of data stream.\nWhen processing a buffer with the capability other/tensors-flexible, developer should append or parse the tensor information in buffer using various utility functions.\nThe buffer of other/tensors-flexible may have single memory or multiple memory chunks.\nNNStreamer element with other/tensors-flexible capability gets the number of memories in a buffer and handles each memory as a tensor.\nNote that, it also has a limit, the maximum allowed number of memory chunks in a buffer is 16.\n"});
