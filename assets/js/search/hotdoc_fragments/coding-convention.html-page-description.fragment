fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"coding-convention.html#page-description","fragment":"In general, NNStreamer Application follows The Coding Style of GStreamer for coding convention.\nAll C codes of NNStreamer are required to use K&R with 2-space indenting. Just follow what's already there and you'll be fine. We only require .c files to be indented, headers may be indented differently for better readability. Please use spaces for indenting, not tabs, even in header files.\nWhen you push your commits, apply gst-indent to .c files before you submit a commit with style change.\nIf there is a change due to code style issues, make two separate commits: (Please do not include other codes' style change in the same commit)\nYou may indent differently from what gst-indent does. You may also break the 80-column rule with header files.\nExcept the two, you are required to follow the general coding styles mandated by gst-indent\nDo not use .cpp extensions, use .cc extensions for C++ sources. Use .h for headers.\nWe do not have strict rules on C++ sources, yet, because all the cores are written in C.\nHowever, please try to stick with the same indentation rules (2 spaces) and common senses.\n\ncommit with style change only (i.e., commit gst-indent-formatted original code - not your code change)\ncommit with your code change only (i.e., contents only).\n\n\n[Java] TBD\n[Python] TBD\n[Bash] TBD\n\n\n\napi: API definitions and implementations\n\n\nandroid: Android APIs\n\ncapi: C-APIs (Tizen and others)\nNote that .NET APIs are located at https://github.com/Samsung/TizenFX along with other Tizen .NET APIs\n\n\n\ndebian: Debian/Ubuntu packaging files\n\nDocumentation: Documentations\n\next/nnstreamer: NNStreamer plugins and subplugins that depend on optional or non-standard external packages.
