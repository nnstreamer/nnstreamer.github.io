This model is used for image classification. The input data type of the model is specified as bit width of each Tensor and its input dimension is 3 X 224 X 224. The output data type of the model is the same as the input datatype but the output dimension is 1001 X 1 X 1 X 1.\nTo configure the tensor information, you need to create a new instance of the Tizen.MachineLearning.Inference.TensorsInfo class. Then, you can add the tensor information such as datatype, dimension, and name (optional) as shown in the following code:\n\n"});
