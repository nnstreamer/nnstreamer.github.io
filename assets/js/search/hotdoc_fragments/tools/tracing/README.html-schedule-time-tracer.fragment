fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tools/tracing/README.html#schedule-time-tracer","fragment":"Schedule time tracer\nThe schedule time tracer is very similar to the processing time tracer. The processing time is focused on measuring the time that an element takes to completely process a given buffer and that is why it is measured on the source pad of that element, because when the buffer gets to that point is when the element has finished its process and the buffer is ready to be pushed to next element. On the other side, what the scheduling time tracer does is measuring the elapsed time since one buffer arrived to the sink pad of the element with the immediate consecutive one, without taking in consideration the time needed for the element to compute the arrived data buffer.\n"});
