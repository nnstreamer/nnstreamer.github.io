fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tools/tracing/README.html#bitrate-tracer","fragment":"Bitrate tracer\nThis tracer is similar to the framerate tracer, but instead of measuring the number of frames produced every second, it measures bits.\nThe bitrate tracer displays the number of bits that go out of a source pad in a second. This is a measurement of the bitrate of the stream. It is updated and printed on the output log every second. The data from this tracer is specially useful at the output of encoders, as it will be able to provide the compression rate and the potential variation of the bitrate value over time.\nCurrently, there are no plots available to be generated based on this tracer. This is a feature that is being developed and will be made available in a future release.\n"});
