fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tools/tracing/README.html#gstsharkplot-experimentalunstable","fragment":"gstshark-plot (Experimental/Unstable)\ngstshark-plot is a set of Octave scripts included with GstShark. The gstshark-plot scripts are located in scripts/graphics directory, inside the repository. The main script that processes the data is the gstshark-plot script. Currently, the scripts need to be run on this directory, but on upcoming releases the scripts will be accessible from any path. Make sure the GST_SHARK_CTF_DISABLE environment variable is unset, to enable the generation of the full traces.\nNote that you have to run \"unset GST_SHARK_LOCATION\" statement in order to archive output date into CTF (Common Trace Format, ./gstshark_yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm:ss/) folder.\nAs an alternative method, you can also try to use the experimental Eclipse plug-in at the below webpage.\n\nCTF (Common Trace Format) file: Directory with date and time with the traces of the latest session.\n\n\nhttps://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php?title=GstShark_-_Install_Eclipse_plugin\n\n"});
