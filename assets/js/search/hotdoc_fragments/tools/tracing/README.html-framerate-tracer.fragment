It is common that the frame rate is a design parameter and a requirement for declaring the performance of a pipeline as successful. Also, the frame rate is usually used for determining if the output of pipeline is synced, when both video and audio are involved. The frame rate is the measurement of the frame frequency, that means that it is the measurement of the number of frames that go through the source pad of certain element in a given time. Normally frame rate is expressed in frames per second (FPS).\nThe framerate tracer displays the number of frames that go through every source pad of every element of the pipeline and it is updated and printed on the output log every second.\n"});
