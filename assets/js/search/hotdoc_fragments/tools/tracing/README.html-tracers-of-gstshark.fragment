T\nCPUUsage: Measures the CPU usage every second. In multiprocessor systems this measurements are presented per core.\nGraphic:  Records a graphical representation of the current pipeline.\nBitrate:  Measures the current stream bitrate in bits per second.\nQueue Level:  Measures the amount of data queued in every queue element in the pipeline.\nBuffer:   Prints information of every buffer that passes through every sink pad in the pipeline.\n\n"});
