This gives the user a way of knowing immediately if the host system is capable of running the pipeline without overcharging the cores of the CPU. It is important to mention that the measurements displayed every second by the tracer correspond to the total load of the CPU and it is not the exact data of the load caused by the pipeline at the time of running it. However, the measurements made and printed on the output log give a good idea of how the load of the CPU is behaving at the time of running the pipeline. With this information, it is possible to check if the pipeline produces an unexpected and undesired increase of the load of the CPU that could cause a failure on the system or a failure of the pipeline due to lack of resources.\nThe CPU usage tracer has the capability of measuring every core of the system. In a multiprocessor system, the output log will include the load of each individual core, giving an idea of the effect that the pipeline has on the total CPU consumption on the system.\nCurrently this tracer is only available for GNU/Linux based systems, since the method used to determine the load on every core available is by reading the /proc/stat file.\n"});
