fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"tools/tracing/README.html#interlatency-tracer","fragment":"Interlatency tracer\nThe interlatency tracer measures the time that a buffer takes to travel from one point to another inside the pipeline. The total latency of the pipeline is the time that the buffer needs to go from the source to the sink element (most downstream). However, the interlatency tracer makes it possible to know what route of the pipeline is adding more time to the overall latency by displaying the exact time that the buffer took to go through every element on the pipeline.\n"});
