For example, setting GST_DEBUG to GST_AUTOPLUG:6,GST_ELEMENT_:4, will cause the GST_AUTOPLUG category to be logged at full LOG level, while all categories starting with GST_ELEMENT_ will be logged at INFO level. To get all possible debug output, set GST_DEBUG to *:9. For debugging purposes a *:6 debug log is usually the most useful, as it contains all important information, but hides a lot of noise such as refs/unrefs. For bug reporting purposes, a *:6 log is also what will be requested usually. It's often also worth running with :3 to see if there are any non-fatal errors or warnings that might be related to the problem at hand. Since GStreamer 1.2 it is also possible to specify debug levels by name, e.g. GST_DEBUG=:WARNING,audio:LOG\nUse gst-launch-1.0 --gst-debug-help to obtain the list of all registered categories.\n"});
