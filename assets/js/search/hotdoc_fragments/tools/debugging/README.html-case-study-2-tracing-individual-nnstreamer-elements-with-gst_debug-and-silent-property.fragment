An NNStreamer element can be traced in verbose mode by setting FALSE to the silent property.\nIn each element's source code, there is DEFAULT_SILENT macro that allows you to change the default silent value. Setting FALSE to DEFAULT_SILENT and rebuilding the library will set verbose mode of the element by default without changing your application code.\n"});
