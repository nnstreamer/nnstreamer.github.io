fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"coding-convention.html#c-codes-c-sources","fragment":"C codes (.c sources)\nAll C codes of NNStreamer are required to use K&R with 2-space indenting. Just follow what's already there and you'll be fine. We only require .c files to be indented, headers may be indented differently for better readability. Please use spaces for indenting, not tabs, even in header files.\nWhen you push your commits, apply gst-indent to .c files before you submit a commit with style change.\nIf there is a change due to code style issues, make two separate commits: (Please do not include other codes' style change in the same commit)\n\ncommit with style change only (i.e., commit gst-indent-formatted original code - not your code change)\ncommit with your code change only (i.e., contents only).\n\n"});
