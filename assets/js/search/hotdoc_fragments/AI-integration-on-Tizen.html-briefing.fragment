First, we introduce ai-edge-torch, a python package tool converting PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model. Then, we will introduce how to use TFLite model in Tizen using Machine Learning Service APIs.\nPyTorch is great for training and developing AI models. However, it's not so easy to deploy and use it in on-device. TFLite has great on-device Tizen performance and it's easy to use GPU, DSP, or NPU by its delegate feature. Thus we recommend using TFLite in Tizen, at least for PoC stage (after engineering you may find better solution).\n"});
