This connects gstreamer data stream with neural network frameworks (NNFW) such as Tensorflow or Caffe.\ntensor_filter is supposed to attach an instance of neural network model with the given NNFW as a filter to a gstreamer stream.\nThe input/output stream data type is either other/tensor or other/tensors.\nFor example, if the output of a neural network model has two distinctive output tensors, \"Bounding boxes, uint32[100][4]\" and \"Labels, uint32[100]\", you may use other/tensors as the source pad capability to have both tensors in a single frame of the source pad.\nNote that tensor_filter supports one always source pad and one always sink pad.\n\nWith other/tensor, you may push (or pull) a single tensor for an instance of inference for the given model.\nWith other/tensors, you may push (or pull) multiple tensors for an instance of inference for the given model.\n\n"});
