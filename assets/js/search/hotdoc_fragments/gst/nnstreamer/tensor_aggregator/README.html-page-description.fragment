fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst/nnstreamer/tensor_aggregator/README.html#page-description","fragment":"GstTensorAggregator is a plugin to aggregate the tensor using GstAdapter.\nThis plugin handles the buffer with the unit frame.\nEach incoming or outgoing buffer is supposed a single tensor, which may contain one or multi frames.\nGstTensorAggregator gets the size of one frame with frames-in, aggregates the frames, and pushes a buffer with frames-out frames.\nAfter pushing an outgoing buffer, GstTensorAggregator flushes the frames-flush frames.\nFor example, GstTensorAggregator with the properties frames-in=3, frames-out=4, frames-flush=2\nPlease be informed that, to ensure the tensor configuration, you have to change the dimension if input and output frames are different. (See the property frames-dim.)\nWith larger frames-in values and smaller frames-out values, the output stream may have more frames than its input stream: dis-aggregation.\nFor example, if a neural network model multiplies picture frames of a video stream, generating 120FPS from 30FPS video, aggregated in a single video (in tensor format) stream output, we can generate a 120FPS stream from a 30FPS (4 frames per buffer) stream. If the model generates 4 video (tensor format) streams with other/tensors, we may merge them first and apply aggregator for the same effect.\nOne \"Always\" sink pad exists. The capability of sink pad is other/tensor.\nOne \"Always\" source pad exists. The capability of source pad is other/tensor.\nIt does not support other/tensors because each frame (or a set of frames consisting a buffer) is supposed to be represented by a single tensor instance.\nframes-in: The number of frames in incoming buffer. (Default 1)\nGstTensorAggregator itself cannot get the number of frames in buffer.\nThis plugin calculates the size of one frame with this property.\nframes-out: The number of frames in outgoing buffer. (Default 1)\nGstTensorAggregator calculates the size of outgoing frames and pushes a buffer to source pad.\nframes-flush: The number of frames to flush. (Default 0)\nGstTensorAggregator flushes the bytes (frames-flush frames) in GstAdapter after pushing a buffer.\nIf set 0 (default value), all outgoing frames will be flushed.\nframes-dim: The dimension index of frames in tensor. (Default value is (NNS_TENSOR_RANK_LIMIT - 1))\nIf frames-in and frames-out are different, GstTensorAggregator has to change the dimension of tensor.\nWith this property, GstTensorAggregator changes the out-caps.\nIf set this value in 0 ~ (NNS_TENSOR_RANK_LIMIT - 2) and concat is true, GstTensorAggregator will concatenate the output buffer.\nconcat: The flag to concatenate output buffer. (Default true)\nIf concat is true and frames-out is larger than 1, GstTensorAggregator will concatenate the output buffer with the axis frames-dim.\nGstTensorAggregator receives a buffer with 1 frame (dimension 3:640:480:1), pushes a buffer with 10 frames (dimension 3:640:480:10), and flushes 5 frames after pushing a buffer.\n\n\nframes-in: The number of frames in incoming buffer. (Default 1)\nGstTensorAggregator itself cannot get the number of frames in buffer.\nThis plugin calculates the size of one frame with this property.\n\n\nframes-out: The number of frames in outgoing buffer.
