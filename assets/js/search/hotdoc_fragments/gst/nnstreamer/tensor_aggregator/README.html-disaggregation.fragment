fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst/nnstreamer/tensor_aggregator/README.html#disaggregation","fragment":"Dis-aggregation\nWith larger frames-in values and smaller frames-out values, the output stream may have more frames than its input stream: dis-aggregation.\nFor example, if a neural network model multiplies picture frames of a video stream, generating 120FPS from 30FPS video, aggregated in a single video (in tensor format) stream output, we can generate a 120FPS stream from a 30FPS (4 frames per buffer) stream. If the model generates 4 video (tensor format) streams with other/tensors, we may merge them first and apply aggregator for the same effect.\n"});
