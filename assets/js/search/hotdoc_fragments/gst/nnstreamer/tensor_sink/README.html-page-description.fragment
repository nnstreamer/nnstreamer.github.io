fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"gst/nnstreamer/tensor_sink/README.html#page-description","fragment":"GstTensorSink is a sink plugin for making an application to get a buffer of tensor (or tensors).\nGstTensorSink emits a signal when receiving a buffer from up-stream element.\nAn application can connect a signal new-data, then will get the buffer of tensor.\nOne \"Always\" sink pad exists. The capability of sink pad is other/tensor and other/tensors.\nnew-data: Signal to get the buffer from GstTensorSink.\nstream-start: Optional. An application can use this signal to detect the start of a new stream, instead of the message GST_MESSAGE_STREAM_START from pipeline.\neos: Optional. An application can use this signal to detect the EOS (end-of-stream), instead of the message GST_MESSAGE_EOS from pipeline.\nsignal-rate: New data signals per second (Default 0 for unlimited, MAX 500)\nIf signal-rate is larger than 0, GstTensorSink calculates the time to emit a signal with this property.\nIf set 0 (default value), all the received buffers will be passed to the application.\nPlease note that this property does not guarantee the periodic signals.\nThis means if GstTensorSink cannot get the buffers in time, it will pass all the buffers. (working like default 0)\nemit-signal: Flag to emit the signals for new data, stream start, and eos. (Default true)\nFor more details, see the examples to handle the buffer from GstTensorSink.\n\n\nnew-data: Signal to get the buffer from GstTensorSink.\n\n\nstream-start: Optional.
