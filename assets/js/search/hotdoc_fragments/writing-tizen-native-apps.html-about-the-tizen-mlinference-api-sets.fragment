fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"writing-tizen-native-apps.html#about-the-tizen-mlinference-api-sets","fragment":"About the Tizen ML-Inference API Sets\nThere are two API sets as of Tizen 5.5 M2, Machine-Learning Inference: \"Pipeline\" and \"Single\".\nWith Pipeline API set, you can construct a GStreamer pipeline with NNStreamer elements and GStreamer elements in the \"whitelist\". GStreamer plugins not listed in the \"whitelist\" are not supported by Pipeline APIs. Note that an alias element, tizencamvideosrc (or ML_TIZEN_CAM_VIDEO_SRC macro), denotes a video camera source, which may vary per device; in other words, you don't need to worry whether it's v4l2src or camsrc or whatsoever. For the list of whitelist elements, refer to the Tizen API doc or /etc/nnstreamer.ini.\nWith Single API set, you can invoke a neural network model with an input tensor/tensors without constructing a full pipeline.\n"});
