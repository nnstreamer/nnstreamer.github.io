We need to determine which frames are going to be merged (or muxed) when we have multiple available and unused frames in an incoming sink pad. In general, we might say that the synchronization of frames determines which frames to be used for mux/merge and timestamping rule determines which timestamp to be used among the chosen frames for mux/merge.\nIn principle and by default,\n\nIf there are multiple unused and available frames in a sink pad, unlike most media filters, we take a buffer that arrived most recently.\nFor more about the synchronization policies, see Synchronization policies at Mux and Merge\n\n\n"});
