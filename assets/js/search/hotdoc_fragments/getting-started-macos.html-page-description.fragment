fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"getting-started-macos.html#page-description","fragment":"This manual is work-in-progress and will be progressively updated. In detail, 1) how to run the tests and examples provided with NNStreamer, 2) how to enable and use TensorFlow filters, and 3) how to enable custom filters written by python will be updated very soon. Other things such as how to enable full features of NNStreamer on macOS will be also added later.\nThe following dependencies are needed to compile/build/run.\nThis is the most simple way to install NNStreamer into your macOS system.\nInstall a bunch of packages required to build and run NNStreamer using brew.\nClone the master (default) branch of the GitHub repository of NNStreamer.\n(Optional) You can choose the latest stable release of NNStreamer instead of the bleeding-edge version.\nConfigure using meson.\nBuild and install using ninja. In this instruction, the target files will be installed into the directories, /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 /usr/local/lib/nnstreamer, /usr/local/include/nnstreamer, and /usr/local/etc. You can change the installation root directory (i.e., /usr/local) by providing the other directory for the --prefix option of meson.\n\nPrerequisites\nEasy way: Install via Brew taps (third-party repository)\n\nStarting from scratch: Build from source\n\n\n\nclang/clang++ >= 10.0.0\n\n\nHomebrew\n\n"});
