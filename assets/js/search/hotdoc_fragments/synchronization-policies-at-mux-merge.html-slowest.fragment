It drops buffers which is earlier than this base timestamp. However if the difference with timestamp of previous buffer is smaller than with current buffer, then previous buffer is used.\nFor the case of three pad with different framerates, It merged/muxed\nAs you can see, second and third buffers of srcpad0 are dropped. Because it is smaller than slowest pts (100000000). For the case of 99999999 PTS of srcpad0, it is taken even if it is also smaller than slowest pts. That is because difference with slowest pts ( 100000000 - 99999999 ) is smaller than of next buffer (133333333 - 100000000).\n"});
