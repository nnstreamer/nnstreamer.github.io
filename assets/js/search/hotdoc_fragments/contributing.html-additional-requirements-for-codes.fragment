If the feature is more invasive or richer, you need more and richer test cases. Refer to other test cases in /tests directory, which use either GTest or SSAT.\nWhen new test cases are introduced, the number of new negative test cases should be larger than or equal to the number of new positive test cases.\nFor C-code, try to stick with C89.\nFor C++-code, try to be compatible with C++11. C++ code should be able to be built optionally. In other words, by disabling C++ build option, we should be able to build the whole system without C++ compilers.\nAvoid introducing additional dependencies of libraries. If you are going to use additional libraries, your codes may be located at /ext/* so that they can be \"optional\" features.\nIf your functions or structs/classes are going to be accessed by other modules or NNStreamer users, provide full descriptions of all entries with Doxygen.\nPassing all the tests of TAOS-CI is a necessary condition, but not a satisfying condition.\n\n"});
