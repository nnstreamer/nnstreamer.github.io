It will be supported for a while, but it is not recommended to use other/tensor. Use other/tensors,num_tensors=1 instead.\n\nformat = { static, flexible, sparse } is added for other/tensors. The conventional other/tensors corresponds to other/tensors,format=static.\n\nformat = static is the default. If the format is not specified and cannot be automatically negotiated and fixed, static is applied.\n\n"});
