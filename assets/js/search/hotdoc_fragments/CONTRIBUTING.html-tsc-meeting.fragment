A chairperson or its deputy, who is designated by a chairperson or the former chairperson, may announce and hold a TSC meeting. A deputy designated by a former resigning chairperson should hold a TSC meeting to elect a new chairperson and is relieved automatically by electing a new chairperson.\nA TSC meeting should be announced via the nnstreamer-announce LFAI mailing list (the mailing list). Other media (GitHub issues, gitter.im, social media, LFAI event calendar, and so on) may also be used along with the mailing list.\nA TSC meeting should be held at a publically accessible place. A TSC meeting is, by default, held conventionally (offline meeting) in a place where the chairperson or its deputy has announced. However, alternatively, a TSC meeting may be held virtually (audio or video conference) with publically available media that are declared with the meeting announcement. A conventionally-held TSC meeting may include audio or video conferences to help those who cannot present physically.\nA TSC meeting is, by default, recorded or scripted for the general public. The URLs or the contents of the recordings or scripts should be available via the mailing list. Alternatively, a live video stream may be broadcasted via methods declared by the mailing list.\nIn the case of the unavailability of the mailing list, a pinned GitHub issue of https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer can be used instead.\n"});
