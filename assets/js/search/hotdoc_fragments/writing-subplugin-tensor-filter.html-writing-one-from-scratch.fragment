By registering a tensor_filter object (a struct instance of GstTensorFilterFramework) with an init function, NNStreamer recognizes it with the given name. In the template code, it is registered with a function init_filter_${name}(). For more information, refer to the doxygen entries of GstTensorFilterFramework in the header file.\nFor more information about the struct, refer to Doxygen Doc on GstTensorFilterFramework.\n"});
