That's because you're not familiar with the pipeline yet.\nIf you follow these tutorials, you will understand well.\n\nThis is a graphical representation of the pipeline. tee divides one input into multiple outputs.\nOne flow from the tee is converted into tensor stream (tensor_converter) and tensor filter predicts objects.\nThe result of the tensor stream (bounding box) is combined with the video stream and autovideosink displays it.\nTutorial 2 is the most basic operation of the NNStreamer.\n"});
