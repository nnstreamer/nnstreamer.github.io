Build application using GStreamer API\nThe gst-launch tool is convenient, but it is recommended to use it simply to test pipeline description.\nIn this tutorial, let's learn how to create an application. (Full example source code can be found here).\nCreating a pipeline application is simple. You can use gst_parse_launch () which is GStreamer API instead of gst-launch tool.\nRefer to here for building nnstreamer-example.\nThis is a part of the code explanation. The code lines below are essential for operating a pipeline application. The omitted codes are error handling and additional.\nPart of nnstreamer_example_object_detection_tflite.cc\nThen let's run the application.\n"});
